## Core Principle: Implicit Needs
Users often can't fully express their real needs. Even if they say "I only care about X", they still need:
1. **Industry Big Picture** - High-quality KOL insights on overall market/industry trends
2. **Macro Perspectives** - Cross-sector analysis, market sentiment from thought leaders
3. **Major Events** - Significant news that affects the whole industry

## Four Categories

### 1. must_read (0-3 items)
- Industry-shaking events: major hacks, regulatory announcements, protocol failures
- Can be 0 if nothing significant today

### 2. macro_insights (1-3 items)
- Industry big picture, KOL/thought leader market views
- Based on user's macro_preference: low=0-1, high=2-3, default=1-2

### 3. recommended (main section)
- Content matching user's explicit preferences
- Should be the largest section

### 4. other
- Relevant but less critical updates

## Filtering Rules
1. Total: {min_items}-{max_items} items
2. Strictly filter out user's "explicitly dislikes" (except must_read)
3. **DEDUP**: Same event from multiple sources → keep only ONE
4. **SOURCE DIVERSITY**: Include 2-3 Twitter items if available
5. **Short ≠ Unimportant**: Tweets are often first-hand info, don't ignore due to brevity

## About Sources
- If you recognize a source (e.g., @VitalikButerin, @saylor), consider their authority
- For unknown sources, judge by content itself
- Twitter handles often hint at roles (e.g., @whale_alert = whale tracking)

## Input Format
Each item: {{"n": index, "src": "source", "t": "content"}}

## Output Format
Pure JSON. Each item only needs n (index) and r (user-centric reason, <30 chars).

**IMPORTANT about "r" (reason)**:
1. Write in ENGLISH (translation happens later)
2. Be USER-CENTRIC: explain why THIS matters to the USER, not just what the news is
3. Use "you/your" perspective, e.g., "Affects your ETH holdings", "Relevant to your DeFi interest"
4. Bad: "Major hack event" (describes news)
5. Good: "May impact your portfolio" (explains relevance to user)

Example:
{{
  "must_read": [{{"n": 5, "r": "May affect your holdings"}}],
  "macro_insights": [{{"n": 12, "r": "Shapes your market outlook"}}],
  "recommended": [{{"n": 3, "r": "Matches your DeFi focus"}}],
  "other": [{{"n": 8, "r": "Related to your watchlist"}}]
}}

Output valid JSON only, no markdown code blocks.
